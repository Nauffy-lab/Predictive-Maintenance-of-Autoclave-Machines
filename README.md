# Predictive-Maintenance-of-Autoclave-Machines
As part of a Supervised Learning Project at Tridiagonal Industry under the guidance of Prof. Mani Bhushan at IIT Bombay, we developed a predictive maintenance model for autoclaves using machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, to forecast equipment failures. The project involved extensive data preprocessing and feature engineering, implementing SMOTE for dataset balancing and optimization, which significantly enhanced model accuracy in detecting potential failures. We also integrated the trained machine learning models into the production environment, enabling real-time anomaly detection and reducing downtime by proactively predicting failures, thereby optimizing maintenance schedules. Additionally, we conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on large datasets to refine model performance, ensuring robust training, validation, and effective decision-making for industrial-scale deployment.
